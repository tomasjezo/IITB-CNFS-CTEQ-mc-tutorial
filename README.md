# IITB-CNFS-CTEQ Monte Carlo Tutorial, February 2026

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce essential tools for making predictions at collider experiments (EIC, LHC, ...). Through a series of simple examples, we will cover the basics of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, including how to generate events, store them, and analyse the results using a standard analysis toolchain. 

## Session 1 - Monday, 09.02.2026

We opened with a compact introduction to the basic components of MC event generators (see the slides). We then briefly explained the idea behind the essential technical prerequisite: `Docker`. 
In this tutorial, `Docker` containers provide all the required software, which would otherwise be challenging and time-consuming to install on your personal host systems. 
Since we will work with `Docker` containers throughout the tutorial, we begin with an introduction or refresher on how to use them: [docker_notes.md](docker_notes.md).
