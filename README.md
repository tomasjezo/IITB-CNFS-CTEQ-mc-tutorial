# IITB-CNFS-CTEQ Monte Carlo Tutorial, February 2026

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce essential tools for making predictions at collider experiments (EIC, LHC, ...). Through a series of simple examples, we will cover the basics of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, including how to generate events, store them, and analyse the results using a standard analysis toolchain. 

## Session 1 - Monday, 09.02.2026

We opened with a compact introduction to the basic components of MC event generators (see the slides). We then briefly explained the idea behind the essential technical prerequisite: `Docker`. 
Throughout the tutorial, `Docker` containers provide all the required software, which would otherwise be challenging and time-consuming to install on your own host systems. 
It is therefore essential that everyone is familiar with how to operate them. We continue with a hands-on introduction to using `Docker`: [docker_note.md](docker_notes.md).
