# IITB-CNFS-CTEQ Monte Carlo Tutorial, February 2026

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce essential tools for making predictions at colliders (EIC, LHC, ...). Through a series of simple examples, we will teach the basics of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, including how to generate events, store them, and analyse the results using a standard analysis tool chain. 

## Session 1 - Monday, 09.02.2026

We opened with a compact introduction to basic components of MC event generators, see the slides. Then we briefly went explained the idea behind the essential technical prerequisite: `Docker`. 
In this tutorial `Docker` containers will provide all the software required, which can otherwise be challenging and time-consuming to install on the host system. 
Since we will work with `Docker` containers throughout, we need an introduction/recap of how to work with it: [docker_notes.md](docker_notes.md).
